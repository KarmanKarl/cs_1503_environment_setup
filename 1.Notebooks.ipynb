    "1. How to use Excel more in depth, as I have used Excel in the past, but never really went in depth with all of its functions and mechanics.\n",
    "2. A little bit about statistics, I am taking a statistics course in tandum with this one and I figure with how much this course intertwines with statistics I very well might learn some ideas abd concepts that will help me in that other course.\n",
    "3. How to use python (at least to some extent) as I have only ever used java."
